-- ################################

[Demon Form]
- Increased Speed Buff: 20% -> 40%
- Now Sets your HP to 500 rather than giving you 400 on top of what you had
- You lose max HP while burning out to prevent using any items to heal back up
- You can only use the demon form meele weapon (No guns or store bought items)
- You now make random ambient zombie noises
// This should make Demon Form less OP. 
// It is now stronger, but you die faster and can't use guns / items 
// Demon blade is a basic melee weapon with good DPS and speed

[Super Crowbar]
- Greatly increased its push force
- Removed it's ability to attack like a regular crowbar
- Now only has 2 uses
- Removed Velocity Clamps (No Push Restrictions)
// This means you can now push in any direction up or down and they will fly there
// Like the baseball bat from worms
// Can also be used to boost / launch allies???
// It's now MUCH stronger but has limited uses 
// If you wanted a melee weapon to go on a rampage with, buy Demon Form

- Increased Uses: 1 -> 3

[Man Hack Swarm]
- Deployment Range: 1500 -> Infinite
- Increased Amount of man hacks: 8 -> 9
