1. No RDM (Random Death Match)

As an INO or a DET killing / injuring another INO or DET
As a TRA killing or injuring another TRA without their consent

Killing or Injuring is classed as directly or passively setting something in motion that will cause damage to another player.
(For example Shooting someone in the head)
(For example tasing someone underwater so they drown)
(For example standing between someone and the train (Body Blocking) causing them to get crushed)
(For example using or moving or breaking a prop so they fall / get prop damaged)

This does NOT include setting something in motion that then requires another player to have to do something after you to RDM
As the second person in the chain of events will be the Killer / RDMer not you
(For example if you tase a innocent and then the traitor knifes them)

2. No Griefing

Do something to another player which annoying or doesn't make any progress towards your Role's goal for the sole purpose of harassment
(For example body blocking to prevent someone from passing a ladder or doorway)
(For example crowbar pushing someone unless you are trying to kill them)
(Detective non-lethal weapons are not included in this as that is what they are there for but just don't be a dick with them)

3. No Traitor Baiting

As an innocent, do not act like a traitor
(For example, shooting near people)
(For example, trolling by pretending to do traitorous activities)

4. No Rule Baiting 

Trying to get others to break the rules or forcing/tricking someone into breaking the rules
(For example standing near or under a avoidable damage source to deal karma damage to someone or make them RDM you)

5. No Cheating

No Cheats, Hacks, Scripts, External Programs, Ghosting, Meta Gaming or anything that doesn't fit the honourable nature of TTT
