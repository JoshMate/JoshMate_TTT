-- #### Gameplay
-- ################################

[Big Boy]
- A [Good] Care package loot item
// An extremely powerful revolver that shoots explosive rounds
// Perfect range and accuracy, this thing will deal 100 damage on a direct hit
// And deal lessor explosive splash damage to those who are close where you hit
// The damage type is explosive, so bomb squad will block half of it
// Comes with 1 bullet and must be reloaded after each shot
// Consumes Heavy Ammo

[Shredder]
- A [Good] Care package loot item
// An extremely powerful machine gun
// It fires its entire 500 round magazine very quickly with a single mouse click (500 Round Burst lmao)
// It takes a bout 5 seconds to spin up, and people will know you're spinning up
// It is very hard to control, but once it spins up, it is unstoppable
// Can only be used once as it litterally explodes in your hands after it has emptied it's mag
// Once it has begun spinning up, it cannot be swapped out

[C4]
- Innocents can no longer Plant / Arm C4
- They can still defuse / destroy the C4
// This is because apart from for trolling why would they ever want to?
// Other innos can just stand in it / attempt to defuse it and nuke the planters Karma
// (This happened to me and it was defused and sent me straight to 0)
// (And both parties were innocents, so it just seems like a system asking for trouble)
// It also fixes a Traitor revealing exploit to do with who can and can't see C4 HUD Icons

[Portable Tester]
- Fire Rate Delay: 2.0 -> 1.0 Seconds

[Bear Trap]
- Number of Beartraps: 1 -> 2
- Now tells you who freed you so you can thank them
- The traps can now be shot / destroyed more consistently in a single shot
- Added some spark effects to destroying / removing / trapping
- You can no longer pickup and re-use bear traps
// This is to prevent the infinite trap exploit that soap/traps used to have
// But the more I think about it, it helps balance out the new 2 use Bear Trap
