Josh Mate TTT Update 63 - Patch Notes
###################################
#### New Stuff
###################################

[Game Mode: Proxy Voice]
- New game mode
- You play the whole round with Proxy Voice turned on

[Dash Grenade]
- Gives you a huge burst of speed for 4 seconds
- The buff only works while you keep your hands empty

[Pushing Other Players]
- Greatly Improved how karma / Kill Attribution is calculated for pushing other players
// You will now only Get hit markers / lose karma if you push someone directly to damage / death
// E.g. if I push Bob and bob then walks over to an edge and jumps off, it will be suicide not RDM

[Pickup Stick]
- Held Props now no longer collide with players (This is to prevent karma free prop push kills)
// This was a SUPER grey area,  both accidents and trolls happen because of this mechanic
// They still collide with everything else AND go back to normal when dropped or thrown

[Loot: Name Jumbler]
- A rare care package loot
- Replaces everyone's names with "* * * * *" until the next round

[Loot: Rob from TTT]
- A rare care package loot
- He's friendly, Koen will be sad if you kill him :(
