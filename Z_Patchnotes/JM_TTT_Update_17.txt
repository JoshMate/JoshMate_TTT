[Gameplay]

- Removed [Flare Gun] 
// Its functionality has been split between the following three items: Inferno Grenade, Poison Dart and Cannibal

- Added [Poison Dart] for Traitors
// A silent and long range weapon that deals very low damage over a long period of time
// Heals the user for the damage dealt to the target over time.
// Eg. The target takes 2 dmg a second for 30 seconds, while the user heals 2 HP a second for 30 seconds
// Players will be informed that they have been poisoned
// The effects stops if the target dies (Can only steal hp while they have it to steal)
// The effect can't overheal (But can heal up to your max Bonus HP from other sources)
// Healing at the Detective Health Station or buying vigor will remove poison
// It only has 5 uses


- Added [Cannibal] for Traitors
// A utility weapon which allows the player to consume corpses (prop_ragdolls)
// Eating a corpse will increase your max HP by 10 and heal you for 10
// It will also convert the corpse into a pile of bones which REMOVES all corpse information
// Doing so makes a meaty noise, so people will know if they are nearby
// It has 5 uses (+50 Max HP) and you must be very close to the corpse

- Added [Vigor] for detectives
// A passive which grants +20 Max HP and fully heals the buyer
// Removes the debuffs: (Tased) and (Poisoned)

- Reworked [Inferno Grenade]
// Still an AOE area denier which burns an area and all in it.
// The damage has been converted from lots of exponential flame sources to a single constant sphere
// This means you will get hurt for the same amount anywhere in the radius, rather than like 37 or 4 at random
// It burns for alot longer now but does damage at a slower rate
// A cloud of orange smoke will now outline the rough radius of where it will hurt you
// The damage is now properly resisted by toughness, applied to hit markers and karma
// Overall I think this makes the grenade more predictable and consistent, but less randomly insta-killy

- Reworked [C4]
// Overall the C4 Will now be far more consistent, powerful, predictable (for the Traitor).
// Radius can take out a full Sky Town Island and damage those around
// Damage now falls of linearly from 150 to 0 over the 1200 unit distance
// Before it had some really sharp falloff and would be like a a few inches between insta kill and totally fine
// The Knockback will still happen and you can survive if you are on the outskirts of the blast (But still take DMG)
// Explosions from a failed defuse are now more deadly than they wer e before (50% of a real one)
// Longer Fuses are NO longer quieter (To be More consistent in this engine)
// Beep is a bit louder to account for larger radius and to encourage defusing (Fail still causes a boom)
// Toughness will let you survive C4 Blast radius about 25% deeper into the explosion than normal

- Buffed [Defuser] Holder's Detection Radius for C4 Increased: 300 -> 1000
- Buffed [Defuser] Beep Sound when holding massively increased
