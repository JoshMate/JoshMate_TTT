[Gameplay]

- Reworked [Firewall] When placing it, it will be invisible for 15 seconds then deploy instantly.
// People will not know that you have placed it, until it appears and you are long gone
// Before firewall was really hard to use because everyone could see you place it and all attack you
// This should make it more covert and more of a long term trap
// Added a HUD UI marker for fellow Traitors


- Buffed [Soap] It no longer makes a weird clicking noise when you place it (Which was audible to others)
