[ Update 16 ] - (Josh Mate's TTT2 Server)

[Server]

- Changed [Loading screen] Now displays the next map

- Reworked [Map Vote]
// Now displays map icons! (Very Pretty)
// No longer stops maps from being votable (Was a bug)

[Gameplay]

- Reworked [LMG]
// Changed it to now be:
// A mid range automatic weapon that is between the SMG and the Rifle with 100 rounds and a movement debuff

- Reworked [Newton Laucher]
// It is now a 2 shot weapon (like the awp)
// It silenty shoots a bolt of energy where you are aiming
// If this hits a wall or anything it will explode and push everything away from it.
// It is basically a long range and instant double strength Push Grenade explosion on demmand
// Its fun to use, but very situational

- Reworked [Health Station]
// Changed potential healing from 200 -> 400
// It no longer recharges its healing capacity over time
// It will still heal up to 100HP on a player and at the same speed
// It will now just heal up to 400 HP rather than INFINITE
// This will help with some undiscovered survive for ever while out the map bugs

- Reworked [Smoke Grenade] 
// Smoke clouds are now much smaller
// Smoke clouds start as a large plume and get smaller (Used to be the other way round)
// They are now thicker
// They should hopefully be more viable at quickly distorting vision without covering up the whole map

- Nerfed [All Shops] Items are not re-buyable
// Every item can only be purchased ONCE (1x times) (Once per round, NOT once per map or game.)
// (This does not affect what your team can buy)
// This is to stop spammy or repeatable tactics
// And hopefully encourage some diversity and experimentation

- Buffed [Rifle] Bodyshot Damage: 35 -> 40
- Nerfed [Rifle] Headshot Damage: 105 -> 80
// 1 Tapping Was completely OP, It had to be nerfed (Blame a certain CSGO tryhard for this one)
// 2 Tapping is still viable if you can control the HEAVY recoil

- Buffed [All Grenades] Throw distance/velocity increased: 100% -> 150%
// They should now feel even less sluggish to throw

- Buffed [Knife] Throwing should now be straighter and more consistent (Like the grenades)
- Buffed [Knife] Throw distance/velocity increased: 100% -> 150%
// Should now be more consistent and nice like the grenades

- Buffed [The Defender] Increased the scope zoom (Same as awp now): 20 -> 10 (FOV)
- Buffed [Sniper] Increased the scope zoom (Same as awp now): 20 -> 10 (FOV)
- Nerfed [Sniper] Has terrible Accuracy when No scoping. Perfect when scoped in (Like COD)
- Nerfed [AWP] Has terrible Accuracy when No scoping. Perfect when scoped in (Like COD)
// Stops you from using the sniper as a shotgun and the awp as a knife

- Buffed [Silenced Pistol] Spread: 0.015 -> 0.0125
- Fixed [Silenced Pistol] Is now quieter (A bug had prevented it from being  this in the first place)

- Buffed [Grenade: Explosive] Damage: 40 -> 50 (Although this will be more like 60-80 in game)
- Buffed [Grenade: Explosive] Radius: 400 -> 500

- Buffed [Taser] Uses: 2 -> 3
