- Reoworked [Rules]
// The !MOTD has been re-written to be much clearer and shorter

- Reworked [Karma] 
// The system is now hits MUCH harder, but will let you get back to normal faster

- Changed [Karma] Karma lost per HP done wrongly: 2 -> 3
// Deal 100 -> 0 damage to a player will cost you 500 karma

- Changed [Karma] Karma Punishment: Damage
// Your damage will be linked to your karma ( The less karma, the less damage you deal)
// Your damage can be reduced to a minimum of 50% at 500 Karma
// With the old system it could go down all the way to 10%

- Changed [Karma] Karma Punishment: Sit Out
// If you are BELOW 500 Karma you will sit the next round out and your karma will be reset to 500
// Sitting out players are counted as spectators when it comes to assigned roles
// For example: 7 players - 1 sitting out = no detective that round as there are only 6 players

- Changed [Karma] Karma Healing
// While you karma is atleast 500, you will heal 100 karma per round back up to 1000
// While you karma is atleast 1000, you will heal 50 karma per round back up to 1250

- Changed [Karma] Right Clicking with crowbar now gives out karma hits if they take damage as a result of your push
- Changed [Karma] You must have atleast 1000 Karma to be selected as the detective
