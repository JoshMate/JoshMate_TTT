- Reoworked [Rules]
// The !MOTD has been re-written to be much clearer and shorter

- Reworked [Karma] 
// The system is now hits MUCH harder, but will let you get back to normal faster

- Changed [Karma] Reduced Max Karma: 1250 -> 1000
// This is to prevent "Free Kills" and also make it easier for me to reset peoples karmas

- Changed [Karma] Karma lost per HP done wrongly: 2 -> 3
// Deal 100 -> 0 damage to a player will cost you 500 karma

- Changed [Karma] Karma Punishment: Damage
// Your damage will be linked to your karma ( The less karma, the less damage you deal)
// Your damage can be reduced to a minimum of 50%
// With the old system it could go down all the way to 10%

- Changed [Karma] Karma Punishment: Slay
// If you are BELOW 300 Karma you will be slayed at the start of the next round and you karma reset to 300
// If you are BELOW 600 Karma you will be slayed at the start of the next round and you karma reset to 600
// For Example: At 200 Karma you will be slayed twice over the next two rounds and end up with 600 karma
// While you karma is atleast 600, you will heal 100 karma per round back up to 1000

- Changed [Karma] Right Clicking with crowbar now gives out karma hits if they take damage from a fall
