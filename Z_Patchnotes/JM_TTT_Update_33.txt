[Spectator]
- You can now see all traps / hazards / care packages / while dead 
- You can also still see your radar scans if you died with one.
// This will give the spectators more information about what is going on

[All Weapons]
- Rewrote the new Range system to check for range as the bullet hits not before the bullet is fired
- This should prevent incorrect damage calculations caused by packet loss / 1 frame off issues
- For example this will fix the shotgun sometimes hitting like a 30 at point blank range
- It will also feel more responsive
- Smoothed out the ranged damage curve, so your damage loss should be less sudden and jarring

[Manhack Swarm]
- Reduced number of manhacks deployed: 12 -> 8 Manhacks
- Manhack life span: 60 -> 45 Seconds
- Increased range of deployment: 800 -> 1500 Units

[Care Package Loot]
- Ninja Blade Movement speed Bonus: 20% -> 30%
- Mega Tracker now plays Jake's Ping sound when it activates
- Tripping balls has even worse screen effects
