Josh Mate TTT Update 78 - Patch Notes
###################################
#### New Stuff
###################################

[The Goomba]
- Has once again been FULLY FREED
- (This was mainly because the code keeping it locked up was spaghetti)
- (So have fun and please don't abuse it <3)

[Disarming Grenade]
- New Detective Item
- Replaces "Stun Grenades"
- Causes players to have their primary and secondary weapons deleted
- This does not delete store bought items or carepackage items
- Also slows and disorientates them for 5 seconds
- Only has 1 use and is thrown like the old stun grenade 

[Weapon Dropping System]
- Made all the weapons and items have consistent drop rules
- If the weapon is bought from a shop (T or D) then it CAN'T be dropped
- All other weapons and items are now droppable

###################################
#### Game Changes
###################################

[Game Modes]
- Removed Crowbar man mode
- Removed Low Ammo mode
- (Pistol round achieves a similar thing without diluting the game mode pool)
- Power Hour now removes your current weapons first so you ALWAYS get a reward

[Map Voting]
- Map voting will now be 2 way map vote by default
- I've also created a manual override if we ever want to do old style full voting

[AWP]
- After firing the AWP the user receives a short slow
- A shot from the AWP now leaves behind a clear tracer showing where it came from
- Increased the movement speed penalty for holding the AWP: 20% -> 50%

[Landmine]
- Can now be defused by anyone by pressing E with empty hands
- The explosion will now only kill you if you stand directly on it
- The explosion now no longer hits you through walls
- Now slows and disorientate players caught in the blast for a short time

[Bear Trap]
- Removed collisions of the trap when someone is caught in it
- This should prevent blocking and allow for more consistent "Frees / Disarms"

[Motion Sensor]
- Fixed spelling mistake in item name "Motion Sesnor"

[Mega jump grenade]
- Buffed number of uses: 2 -> 3 Uses

[Shredder]
- Dropping a spun up shredder will always make it explode so you can't avoid it now

[Loot: Landmine Apocalypse]
- The land mines will now be the correct size and function properly
