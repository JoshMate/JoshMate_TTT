- Changed [Karma] Karma healed per round when at over 1000 karma: 50 -> 25
// Bonus karma takes longer to build up, but it lasts all night (until you rdm)

- Changed [Karma] While healing up to 1000, you can no longer over heal in the same round fully heal
// Example: If you're on 999, you used to go to 1099. Now you'd just go to 1000
// This is to make sure you only get bonus karma using the slower 25 per round karma gain

- Changed [Voice Chat] Spectators can now see when a traitor is using their red team chat
// Before all speakers would be green regardless of what chat they were using

- Changed [Hit Markers] Damage Numbers on screen now account for Karma / Damage Multipliers
// Before, you always look like you were doing full damage even if you weren't 
// Now your hit marker damage numbers will say the exact amount of damgae you actually did

- Buffed [Poison Dart] Duration: 12 -> 15 Seconds

- Fixed [Bug] Mega Tracker wasn't tracking everyone when it was meant to be
- Fixed [Bug] Players who were sitting out could still be selected as Traitors or Detectives

- Reworked [Speed Dating]
// Before, being stuck in a pod with a traitor was basically just wait to get knifed
// People would just constantly scream who their with and it didn't really play very well
// The map now is split down the middle at the start of the round, and there are now only "2 Pods"
// The north and the south side of the map, so you will be with one half of the players at a time
// You can explore your entire half of the map, but the barrier in the middle doesn't go until after 30 - 60 seconds
// The map should now be less of a maze too
// There is a new grand central room
// The hall ways are now much better lit up with lights
