[Patch Notes]
- New easier to read patch notes with less boiler plate

[Karma]
- While healing up to 1000, you can no longer over heal in the same round fully heal
// Example: If you're on 999, you used to go to 1099. Now you'd just go to 1000
// This is to make sure you only get bonus karma using the slower 25 per round karma gain
- Karma healed per round when at over 1000 karma: 50 -> 25
// Bonus karma takes longer to build up, but it lasts all night (until you rdm)

[Voice Chat]
- Spectators can now see when a traitor is using their red team chat
// Before all speakers would be green regardless of what chat they were using

[Hit Markers] 
- Damage Numbers on screen now account for Karma / Damage Multipliers
// Before, you always look like you were doing full damage even if you weren't 
// Now your hit marker damage numbers will say the exact amount of damgae you actually did

[Sudden Death] 
- Sudden Death no longer tracks players, it just plays the music and the notification
// I can manually track all players manually aswell if needed
// It still only happens rarely when I deam it to be necessary

-- #### Gameplay
-- ################################

[Chameleon]
- You no longer have a feint outline while invisible (You are now completely Invisible)
- You now longer get blood splatters on you while invisible
// Although these two effects were cool, they were inconsistent and it was frustrating to die because of them

[Pulse Pad]
- Track Duration: 60 -> 90 Seconds
- Only The detective can see players tracked by the pulse pad

[Poison Dart]
- Duration: 12 -> 15 Seconds
- Total Damage/Healing: 62 -> 75 HP

[Silenced Pistol]
- Duration: 5 -> 7 seconds

-- #### Bug Fixes
-- ################################

- Fixed Mega Tracker wasn't tracking everyone when it was meant to be
- Fixed Players who were sitting out could still be selected as Traitors or Detectives
- Fixed Sitting out players were not affecting the Traitor Percentage, making more Ts than there should have been
- Fixed The scoreboard would show players who are sitting out as alive confusing who's actually left

[Speed Dating]
// Large Map Rework
// The map now is split down the middle at the start of the round, and there are now only "2 Pods"
// Before, being stuck in a pod with a traitor was basically just wait to get knifed
// People would just constantly scream who their with and it didn't really play very well
// The north and the south side of the map, so you will be with one half of the players at a time
// You can explore your entire half of the map, but the barrier in the middle doesn't go until after 30 - 60 seconds
// The map should now be less of a maze too
// There is a new grand central room
// The hall ways are now much better lit up with lights

[Lost at Sea]
// Added floating Buoys out to sea that you can stand on
// The borders will now block props and items, not just players now
// The border has been made a bit clearer so you know where the edges of the map are
// The sea is now much shallower, to prevent Traitor shark from being Completely OP
// Improved the glass texture on the boats
// The Raft is now indestructable and heavier (To prevent wacky physics shit)
// Added a Sea Shanty 2 as an Easet Egg (Hint: avian extermination)
// You can no longer possess the raft (Stops spectators being able to insta kill other people)
