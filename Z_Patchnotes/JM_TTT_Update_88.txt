Josh Mate TTT Update 88 - Patch Notes
###################################
#### Gameplay
###################################

[Item Shop]
- An experimental test of a new shop system that will hopefully completely mix up the meta
- Shops now consist of 2 randomly chosen items.
- Once one of them has been purchased, both items are randomly re-rolled to new ones
- This affects both Traitor and Detective
- This change is an experiment and may be rolled back if it is a disaster

[Explosives]
- The blast concussion debuff from landmines now gets applied with most explosions
- Now affects: Frag Grenades, Prop Bombs and Doom Dart Explosions
- The effect slows players down and blurs their vision for a short period

[Taser]
- Increased Tase Duration: 12 -> 15 Seconds
- Added a spark effect to show that a player has been tased to others
- No longer deletes all their weapons in their inventory
- Instead they drop the held one on the floor (Like old times)
- The dropped weapon will now fall towards the taser owner

[Flash Bang Grenade]
- Increased Duration of Flash: 5 -> 7 Seconds
- Increased Flash Radius: 300 -> 350 Units
- Fixed the broken Bright white screen so it doesn't look so scuffed
