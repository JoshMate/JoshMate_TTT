[Gameplay]


- Removed [Fire Wall] as it encouraged stalemates and slow camping games
// It has been replaced by the Pulse Pad

- Added [Pulse Pad] A Traitor Trap Weapon
// Placed in the same way as soap and bear trap
// When a player walks over it, it slows and tracks them for 15 seconds
// You get 3 and they are very hard to see

- Nerfed [Light Pistol] Accuracy Spread: 0.010 -> 0.015
- Nerfed [Light Pistol] Magizine Capacity: 20 -> 16
// It is meant to be a jack of all trades between the up close shred of the Auto and long range accuracy of the Heavy
// The last update made it feel like it could do both quite well

- Buffed [Heavy Pistol] Fire Rate Delay: 0.40 -> 0.30
- Buffed [Heavy Pistol] Recoil: 15 -> 12
- Nerfed [Heavy Pistol] Damage: 40 -> 35
// Even more emphasis on carefully planned 1 taps and snipes
// 1 hit kill head shots and the lowest DPS in the game on NON-Headshots

- Buffed [Barrier] HP: 500 -> 650

- Fixed [Beartrap] Fixed an error message by checking for nulls when placing a trap
- Fixed [Soap] Rewrote the whole weapon / Entity to have better presentation
