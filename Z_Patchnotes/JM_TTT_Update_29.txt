[Gameplay]


- Reworked [Fire Wall] It encouraged stalemates and slow games
// Deals no damage
// Slows and tracks the target for 15 seconds
// Lasts forever
// Is very hard to see and makes no sounds
// Breaks after the first person touches it
// 10 Second Arm Time

- Nerfed [Light Pistol] Accuracy Spread: 0.010 -> 0.015
- Nerfed [Light Pistol] Magizine Capacity: 20 -> 16
// It is meant to be a jack of all trades between the up close shred of the Auto and long range accuracy of the Heavy
// The last update made it feel like it could do both quite well

- Buffed [Heavy Pistol] Fire Rate Delay: 0.40 -> 0.30
- Buffed [Heavy Pistol] Recoil: 15 -> 12
- Nerfed [Heavy Pistol] Damage: 40 -> 35
// Even more emphasis on carefully planned 1 taps and snipes
// 1 hit kill head shots and the lowest DPS in the game on NON-Headshots

- Buffed [Barrier] HP: 500 -> 650

- Fixed [Beartrap] Fixed an error message by checking for nulls when placing a trap
