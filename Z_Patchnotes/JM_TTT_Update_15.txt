[ Update 15 ] - (Josh Mate's TTT2 Server)

[Gameplay]

- Added [Taser] A Non-Lethal Detective weapon that stuns targets
/ Stuns the target for 10 seconds
/ Deals no damage and doesn't affect karma
/ Strips the target's non-store-bought weapons (eg. light pistol and rifle)
/ Holstered, magneeto and crowbar will be kept
/ Things like AWP, Knife, Radar, etc... will be kept (Secretly)

- Added [Manhack Swarm] A Traitor weapon that deploys a swarm of manhacks
/ Spawns 8 manhacks that attack all players including the traitors
/ They deploy up to 500 units away in the direction you are facing.
/ can be destroyed by shooting them
/ crowbar is insta kill on them, but you may take damage getting that close
/ they deal small amounts of damage, but make a good harasser / distraction
/ Fixed: the manhack corpse chunks making the floor hard to walk on

- Added [Grenade: Inferno] A Traitor grenade that creates a field of fire
/ A single use lethal greande that creates fire in a large radius around it
/ Explodes on impact (No timer like the other grenades)
/ Burns for a long time, so it will deny an area of space the whole time

- Reworked [Grenade: Fire] is now Grenade: Explosive
/ The fire grenade was super trollable for Innocents
/ You could destroy someones karma by standing in their fire
/ The fire never seemed to ignite the area consistently 
/ It was too underpowered and inconsistent for Traitors
/ I have replaced it with a low damage, large radius explosive grenade
/ Similar to the CSGO frag, it will not kill, but injure people in its radius
/ It will still destroy your karma if you attack friends,
/ But they can't choose to stand in it as easily to annoy you.
