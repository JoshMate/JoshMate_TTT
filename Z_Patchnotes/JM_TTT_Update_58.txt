#### Changes
###################################

[Pre Round Prep Time]

- Pick Up Stick picking up props is no longer possible in prep

[Care Package Swep]

[Care Package Loot: Rooty Tooty]
- Buffed Damage: 3200 -> 4500
- Buffed Number of projectiles: 80 -> 100

[Weapon Tracers]
- Added Blue Tracers to their bullets to show their uniqueness / power
- Added to: All Carepackage weapons and Sniper

[Cannibal]

- Buffed Max Healing on Eat: 75 -> 90 HP

[Doom Dart]

[Karma]
- Now only Traitors and Detectives get their 1250 karma bonus Credit
- Karma can now go below 0 into negative numbers
- Upgraded Karma logs to included the weapon / object that dealt the damage
- type "ttt_print_damagelog" into the console to see last round's damage logs
- Upgraded my karma re-fund admin tools to be able to Un-Sit-out players

[Karma Sitting out]
- Getting your Karma below 0 will now cause you to sit out twice in a row to get back to 500
(This is to prevent something I've seen before where people accidentally RDM once, and then just say:
"well, I'm already sitting out, so I might as well not care now about karma for the rest of the round.")
(It also helps to distinguish between an entire team wipe RDM, and just killing 1 person with higher karma)
(It's also just funny to see huge negative numbers from massive accident game wiping RDMs)

[Messages]
- Went through and re-worked all 78 text messages to the new colour coded system
- Greatly Improved how announcements / text is shown to players
