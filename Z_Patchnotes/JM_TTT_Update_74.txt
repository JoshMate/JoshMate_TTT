#### New Stuff
###################################

[#FreeTheGoomba]
- It's now free

[Auto Unstuck]
- A new experimental system that auto detects "Stuck" players
- After a 7 second of  being "Stuck" it will attempt to teleport you to your last non-stuck position
("Stuck" is any situation where your player model is intersecting a solid object preventing movement)
(This is a trial and if it causes issues or is exploitable then I will remove it)

[Bear Trap]
- Every player can see trapped players on their HUD via a new icon

[New Map: Ice Camp]
- A small isolated research camp out in the frozen wastes
- Innocents must locate the golden cube key and take it to the traitor tester to unlock it
- Careful, spend too much time outside and you'll freeze to death! 
- Use bonfires to warm back up again, but be careful, traitors can destroy them...
// Needs Re-arming

[New Map: Shark Tank]
- An underground industrial water treatment plant
- Innocents must press 4 buttons to reveal a key to the traitor tester
- Lots of water and a large open central room
// Needs Re-arming

[New Map: Dive Hole]

- Players are split between 5 small rooms
- Each room is connected by dark underwater tunnels
- Traitors can close flood gates to block navigation underwater
// Needs Re-arming
