[ Update 22] - (Josh Mate's TTT2 Server)

[Server]

- Changed [Karma] Traitors no longer lose karma for damaging fellow traitors 
// The rules on RDM and damage have not changed though
// This is the prevent accidental C4 Karma wipe outs or trolling by standing in your fellow T's fire etc...
// This also enables agreed team kills for advanced Traitor Tactics
// You will still be HEAVILY punished for team killing a fellow traitor if they press charges

- Changed [Karma] You no longer recieve Positive Karma for "Correct" kills
// This makes RDM even more un-rewarding as if you RDM'd two Traits and an Ino you would not lose karma overall

- Changed [Logging] Greatly Improved the Code for Karma / Kill / Action Logging so I can better solve disputes

[Gameplay]

- Removed [Silenced Pistol] It didn't really fit my current gameplay design philosophies
// No matter how I balanced it, it was either too good or too bad.
// Just use the knife for close range silent kills or the awp for long range silent kills
// Bring it back

- Removed [Health Station] Replaced by Tree of Life

- Added [Chameleon] A traitor Passive
// Noah's Idea and winning item submission from the TTT Design Contest
// An item that grants:
// + Invisibility while standing still 
// - Takes 4 seconds to activate
// - Any action will cancel it
// - You can still look around
// Makes a subtle noise when it activates
// Displays a buff and screen effect so the user knows when they are invisible to others

- Added [Tree of Life] A Detective utility item
// Place down a small tree which passively heals all players who stand near it
// Lasts for about 30 seconds and you get 3 to place (on a flat surface like soap)
// If placed in another TOLs radius, one of the trees will die
// This is to prevent massive amounts of heal stacking and becoming very hard to kill

- Reworked [Teleporter] For both Traitors and Detectives
- Buffed [Teleporter] Teleport Animation is now instant (No more being stunned or waiting)
- Buffed [Teleporter] Can now mark teleport locations anywhere (But not while crouched)
- Buffed [Teleporter] Can now teleport from anywhere
- Buffed [Teleporter] You can no longer be seen holding out the teleporter (You look holstered)
- Buffed [Teleporter] You deploy (Swap to) the Teleporter much faster now
- Changed [Teleporter] Much better HUD Info about how to use and what is going wrong
- Nerfed [Teleporter] Uses: 10 -> 5
- Nerfed [Teleporter] The teleport Effects are bigger and louder
- Nerfed [Teleporter] You can Telefrag after a 5 second delay of marking your spot
// This will make the teleporter way less rigid and a easier to use.
// However this enables some suicidal / stuck positions to be teleported to, so use at your own risk!
// Marking is silent and has no visuals. Recalling is loud and has spark visuals
// Your Momentum is preserved so if you teleport while falling then GG

- Reworked [Grenades]
- Changed [Grenades] Full re-write of the base grenade code
- Changed [Grenades] Now deploy faster and can be thrown instantly after equipping
- Changed [Grenades] Much smoother trajectory and better physics
- Changed [Grenades] Shortened the fuses on ALL grenades to 3 seconds
- Changed [Grenades] Added a sound effect to throwing ALL grenades
- Changed [Grenades] Added a chat message to tell players they can't throw grenades during pre game

- Reworked [Smoke Grenade] it is now "Tag Grenade"
// The smoke grenade was super buggy and engine limited
// It was also barely used apart from just yeeting it for no reason
// Tag grenade can be thrown and upon explosion will tell you how many people were nearby
// Use it for scouting rooms or corners or checking how many people are in a certain place
// Has the CSS Smoke Model

- Reworked [Push Grenade] it is now "Jump Grenade"
// The Push Grenade was a sketchy tool to give to innocents since the RDM potential is soo high
// Traitors never used it because of how clunky it was and how the newton launcher is much better
// The Jump Grenade is a utility nade that when thrown will push you in the opposite direction you threw it
// It explodes on impact making "Rocket Jumping" or "Long Jumping" the main purpose of this nade
// The Grenades push will ONLY affect the user so it can't be used to harras or RDM
// This also stops it from just being the Newton launcher but for innocents
// Left Click to do a direction jump
// Right Click to do a verticle jump
// Has the CSS Flashbang Model

- Reworked [Explosive Grenade] is now "Frag Grenade"
// The explosive damage no longer goes through walls
// The explosion will break windows and props now
// Has the CSS Frag Model

// They still have interesting potential in gameplay though, so I made them part of the Detective's default kit

// Shreds up close, can no longer iron sight to shred at mid range, (that's the Assault Rifle's Job)

- Buffed [LMG] Recoil: 1 -> 0.5 
// Can better spray at all ranges, but is out classed by every gun in those ranges. (It has a 100 mag cap to make up for it) (The true jack of all trades master of none primary for those who aren't massive try hards ;)

// These changes aim to make the primary weapons have more distinction between what ranges they excell at, and stop them from stepping on each others toes in other ranges.
