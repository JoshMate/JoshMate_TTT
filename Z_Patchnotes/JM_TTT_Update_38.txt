[Proximity Voice]
- Player Name Cards will fade from 100% to 20% Transparency depending on how far away the speaker is
- Big cleanup of the code that decideds when you can and can't hear people

[Karma]
- Reduced "Was Pushed  By Crowbar" killed attributing timer from: 15 -> 10 Seconds
// This means that you will still be counted as the killer 10 seconds after the push rather than 15
// If the person you pushed was to die to a map hazard or fall damage

[Super Crowbar]
- New Traitor weapon
// The same as the regular crowbar but with the followind stat changes:
// x2 More Melee damage
// x3 More Right Click Push Force
// x2 Faster Right Clicking
// Destroys any Detective Barrier in a single hit

[Barrier]
- Barrier Health: 700 -> 850
- Detectives can no longer walk and shoot through their own barriers
// This was encouraging detectives to lock them selves in small fotresses and then just shoot out at you
// This was a VERY hard to counter tactic, and was ultimately just very boring to play against

[Chameleon]
- Reduced Ammo: 40 -> 30
- Increased the volume of  the sound played when going invisible

[Cannibal]
- Increased the per body healing from: 50 -> 75 HP
// This does not affect the +25 max hp you get per body

- Made them slightly harder to see

[Barrel Swep]
- Ammo: 5 -> 6
- Spawned Barrels are now red to indicate they aren't naturally occuring
