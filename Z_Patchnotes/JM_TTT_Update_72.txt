Josh Mate TTT Update 72 - Patch Notes
###################################
#### New Stuff
###################################

[Game Mode: Traitor Tester]
- New Game Mode
- Randomly spawns an unmarked Portable Traitor Tester weapon someone on the map

[Game Mode: Slippery Floors]
- New Game Mode
- Is no longer a care package loot, but instead it's own game mode

[Game Mode: Low Gravity]
- New Game Mode
- Is no longer a care package loot, but instead it's own game mode


###################################
#### Changes
###################################

[Game Mode System]
- Game modes are now split up into 2 groups (Innocent driven and All Game Modes)
- The first round will have a 30% chance of being an Innocent driven Game Mode (or no mode)
- The Second round will have a 100% chance of being ANY Game Mode
- This pattern then repeats throughout the evening
(This means the innocents will on average have more things to do in the evening)
(While keeping the meme / crazy Game Modes still rare)

[Game Mode: Power Up]
- Increased number of batteries required to win from: 6 -> 7

[Game Mode: Bounty Hunter]
- Is now no longer enforced on you but:
- The bounty target now takes 2x (Double) damage from traitors
- Killing your bounty target now gives all traitors +10 Max HP

[Game Mode: Infection]
- Reduced Zombie HP from: 60 -> 40 HP
- Zombies can no longer harm traitors
- Zombie Knife now swings a bit faster (Higher DPS)

[Chameleon] 
- Now rather than making you completely invisible, it just makes you EXTREMELY hard to see
(The idea is that risky get out of jail frees will be less viable as people will know to look for your feint outline)

[Cannibal]
- No longer heals you instantly for 100 HP when eating
- Instead heals you 50 HP over 12 seconds similar to heal grenade
- This effect wouldn't stack with other cannibal eats (but would stack other heals)
- You now gain a flat 15 Max HP buff per body rather than a diminishing 50/40/30/20/10

[Radar] 
- Detectives no longer have access to the Radar passive.
(For a more powerful but temporary effect, use UAV instead)

[Land Mine]
- It will now go off if you are very close to it as well as just touching it
- This will prevent getting stuck in it, and make it more dangerous
- This also prevents you just jumping over it, actually blocking off the map now

[Barrier]
- Players affected by the barrier now take 50% increased damage for 30 seconds after
- This effect now has a separate timer to the slow and and has a unique icon
